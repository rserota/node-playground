express notes

express() returns our app object.
app can listen for requests
app.set() sets config (this is run once)

app.get, app.post, app.use get run on every request, until we res.send or res.render

serving static files means that clients can directly request files. don't need to make individual routes for each static file. 

two kinds of middleware. app.use is application middleware, but there's also route-level middleware.

controllers connect routes and views
